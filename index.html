              <p>
                Upon commencing my employment with Hawkeye, I was fortunate enough to exclusively handle Google emails. However, as my 
                responsibilities grew over time, I gradually took on the task of overseeing Hawkeye's campaign partials for the 
                Google Store&nbsp;wing. 
                <br /><br />
                During my tenure, my duties entailed analyzing campaign-specific Figma/Sketch files to create reusable Handlebars 
                and Jinja partials, developing and testing pixel-perfect emails on mobile devices and email testing platforms like 
                Litmus, and performing code reviews for my Hawkeye&nbsp;colleagues.
                <br /><br />
                In the latter stages of my employment, I collaborated solely with Google Store engineers to generate US + rest-of-world AMP emails that 
                incorporated various engaging features for users. Our combined efforts resulted in the successful deployment of
                interactive emails, which reached a vast audience of millions across the&nbsp;globe.

              <p>
                Utilizing the knowledge and skills I gained while working on Google Store emails and partials, my manager entrusted 
                me with the responsibility of assisting the Nest Renew client in creating a reusable set of accessible modules and templates for 
                their forthcoming eco-friendly email campaign&nbsp;updates.
                <br /><br />
                Being the sole developer of this project, I developed reusable email partials utilizing a combination of Handlebars.js 
                and the client's Connect Composer snippet platform. Subsequently, over the following few months, I produced and 
                dispatched several emails to recipients in the United States and&nbsp;Spain.
                <br /><br />
                Over time, I trained additional Hawkeye developers to work on the campaign and produced detailed documentation 
                concerning the frequently used partials and&nbsp;snippets.

                created modular components with JS libraries such as React and jQuery, ensured code quality and longevity through unit tests 
                using RSpec and FactoryGirl, and set up CSV generation using Rails helpers, Sidekiq workers, and application PostgreSQL DB data.
                <br /><br />
                For larger tasks such as implementing new web pages, I pair programmed with the primary database manager to pull in CSV / website data
                to properly populate cirriculum pages.

                various mobile devices and browser platforms to ensure a consistent user experience. Additionally, I facilitated weekly 
                meetings to discuss feature requests, creative designs, and client feedback.

                Working at Starbucks was a transformative experience that changed my life forever. As an introverted individual who struggled 
                with basic social skills, I often envied those who had a natural ability to shine in social settings. However, my desire for 
                change drove me to apply for a job at my local Starbucks. Over the next five and a half years, I underwent a remarkable 
                transformation, becoming the person I always aspired to be.
                <br /><br />
                At Starbucks, I learned invaluable skills that have stayed with me to this day. I honed my ability to connect with others, 
                worked effectively in a fast-paced environment, and leveraged my team to provide unparalleled customer service. Through 
                these experiences, I emerged as a confident, capable, and empathetic person, a far cry from the shy individual I used to be. 
                The skills and qualities I acquired at Starbucks have served me well in both my personal and professional life, making it an 
                experience I will always cherish.
