                <br /><br />The company also ensured that the Figma creative was translated

              <p>
                I worked at Starbucks for five and a half years, and during that time, I experienced firsthand the importance of exceptional 
                customer service. As a barista, I learned how to effectively connect and communicate with customers, making every cup of coffee 
                more than just a transaction. It was an opportunity to engage in meaningful conversation and provide personalized&nbsp;care.
                <br /><br />
                Admittedly, it was not always easy for me. When I first started, I was shy and struggled with basic social skills like maintaining 
                eye contact or carrying a conversation. But, I realized that to succeed in any professional career, I needed to develop these skills. 
                So, over time, through tens of thousands of cups of coffee, I learned how to properly interface with people and make genuine connections. 
                This experience taught me the true value of exceptional customer service and the power of human connection, transforming me into a 
                confident, capable, and empathetic person that I am&nbsp;today.

              <h3 class="headline-role">Intern Developer</h3>
              <p> 
                As a budding intern I primarily worked on TCI's primary web presence -- specifically the cirriculum pages. 
                <br /><br />
                During my stay I: implemented web accessibility compliance WCAG 2.0 to existing Rails views using core front-end technologies, 
                created modular components with JS libraries such as React and jQuery, ensured code quality and longevity through unit tests 
                using RSpec and FactoryGirl, and set up CSV generation using Rails helpers, Sidekiq workers, and application PostgreSQL DB data.
                <br /><br />
                For larger tasks such as implementing new web pages, I pair programmed with the primary database manager to pull in CSV / website data
                to properly populate cirriculum pages.

              <p> 
                I worked as the lead creative designer and web developer for the redesign of the Casa&nbsp;Del&nbsp;Sol website. Using JavaScript, 
                CSS/LESS, and Bootstrap, I implemented mobile responsive functionality and conducted quality assurance tests across 
                various mobile devices and browser platforms to ensure a consistent user experience. Additionally, I facilitated weekly 
                meetings to discuss feature requests, creative designs, and client feedback.

                Working at Starbucks was a transformative experience that changed my life forever. As an introverted individual who struggled 
                with basic social skills, I often envied those who had a natural ability to shine in social settings. However, my desire for 
                change drove me to apply for a job at my local Starbucks. Over the next five and a half years, I underwent a remarkable 
                transformation, becoming the person I always aspired to be.
                <br /><br />
                At Starbucks, I learned invaluable skills that have stayed with me to this day. I honed my ability to connect with others, 
                worked effectively in a fast-paced environment, and leveraged my team to provide unparalleled customer service. Through 
                these experiences, I emerged as a confident, capable, and empathetic person, a far cry from the shy individual I used to be. 
                The skills and qualities I acquired at Starbucks have served me well in both my personal and professional life, making it an 
                experience I will always cherish.
